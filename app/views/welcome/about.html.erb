We want you to love the food you prepare and eat, and have our plans work with your lifestyle, so you’re set up for success.</p>

In my nursing practice, I saw a huge deficit in the 								area of weight management and food information which led me to return to 							school and earn my C.H.N. license from CSNN (Canada School of Natural Nutrition) in 							2010.</p>

These included lack of time to plan for food due to life circumstances, lack of education in reading food labels and knowing what is actually considered healthy food, too many strict dieting programs leading to all or nothing thinking and not keeping the weight off permanently, seasonal holiday stress and lack of motivation around stampede, Christmas, birthdays or events.</p>-->

<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">Over several years, I counselled individuals and led group consultations. During this time, I realized that many people didn’t have the time to plan for food due to life circumstances, lack of education or misinformation about food labels and healthy food choices. I also saw strict dieting programs leading to all or nothing thinking—diets just do not work to keep weight off permanently.  Special events such as Christmas, birthdays, holidays and even periods of long working hours can sabotage the best of intentions. </p>

						<div class="col-md-9">When having a nutritional assessment done with Bethany, the first thing I noticed was her great
attention to detail. She designed very thorough history forms for all of her clients to fill out. This not only includes questions about eating habits but medical history as well. I feel Bethany’s experience in the nursing profession gives her an advantage over others in the nutrition industry because she possesses strong assessment skills and she is able to anticipate medical issues that may create obstacles for achieving a client’s goals. She is very knowledgeable and passionate about nutrition which is obvious when you sit down and talk with her. I also quite enjoyed the finished product that was given to me after the assessment was complete. This was in the form of a binder detailing the assessment and plan for the future to help achieve my dietary health and nutrition goals.</div>

						<div class="col-md-9">I recently signed up with Bethany at Nutritious & Delicious and am very pleased with the results. Bethany did a full, detailed analysis of my lifestyle, day-to-day activities, and food intake. I always had issues with my weight and energy and I knew I wasn't eating copious amounts of bad food and I was exercising 3x/week. Bethany determined that I was actually eating too little (shocking) and that key vitamins and minerals were missing from my diet which explained why I was feeling the way I was.</div>

						<div class="col-md-9">Bethany made up a detailed meal plan for me which left nothing out. It was tailored to the exact calories I needed to consume to achieve my goals, and fulfilled the daily vitamin and mineral requirement. She also made up a detailed, easy to follow shopping list. The list was broken down the way you would find the items in the grocery store so there would be no back and forth.  Bethany's list had recommendations for brands of food, but she explained that if you had a favorite brand you can use it as long as you made sure you were keeping in line with the amount of calories and fat in the meal plan.</div>

						<div class="col-md-9">Thank you Bethany for putting together a great plan for my particular problem.  I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease so eating in and out has become a big challenge for me. Bethany put together a shopping list with things that I liked to eat so nothing was banned (only wheat etc of course) and even made me a shopping list to help me.  She also gave me lots of other useful advice that could maintain my blood sugars and stop me buying fast food, in other words to be prepared instead of finding myself hungry with no snacks on standby etc. She even made up recipes for me to try.  I fully recommend that Bethany do anyone a plan for their lifestyle whatever the problem, mine was a challenging one and she rose to the challenge!  Thank you Bethany.
