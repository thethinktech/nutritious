Do you constantly feel tired and wish you could feel more energized to do the activities you want to do? We have created a meal plan for that family member who doesn't like what everyone else eats.

<br><br>

We have some interesting, hearty recipes the whole family can enjoy. We first find out what you or your teen likes and dislikes about food, then we can customize a meal plan catered to those needs. Based on current activity levels, growing needs, gender and height, we calculate the average daily calorie consumption and go from there. This will help fussy eaters to be proactive in their own health and wellness for the long term.

We have a few different meal plans that we can customize to you and your needs. To sustain your blood sugars our meal plan has balanced fat and protein ratios while keeping healthy fibrous carbs a part of your everyday plan. Eating every few hours is critical to this plan to keep your energy sustained so you are able to go about your day with more ease.


<br><br>
Heart healthy includes much more fresh produce and lowering the saturated animal fats to a minimum. This plan focuses on lean poultry meats and more of a seafood diet to help lower your bad cholesterol over time.

It’s true. Abs come from the kitchen, so let me show you how with a meal plan that is right for you. We will take into account how much exercise you currently do, what type of exercise—whether it be aerobic or weight lifting and your calorie needs. We then create a balanced macro ratio for you to follow.






<br><br>

The meal plan will put an emphasis on increasing your protein consumption while finding healthy forms of carbohydrates for you to lift heavier, or extend your aerobic activity levels. We can also incorporate a cheat meal once a week, depending on how strict you want your plan to be.

<br><br>

If you want to spice up your palate, would like to start eating more organic foods with less pesticides and hormones, let’s get to work. Our meals plans are focused on the Mediterranean and Paleo lifestyle which incorporate many more healthy fats while balancing the protein and carb ratios.
<br><br>
The meal plan focuses on healthy legumes and beans along with lots of fresh fruit, veggies and plenty of fresh fish and healthy fats such as nuts, seeds, and olive oil. This is a sensible plan for someone looking to maintain their weight while creating a new twist to how they currently eat.

I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease so eating in and out has become a big challenge for me. Bethany put together a shopping list with things that I liked to eat so nothing was banned (only wheat etc of course) and even made me a shopping list to help me.  She also gave me lots of other useful  advice that could maintain my blood sugars and stop me buying fast food, in other words to be prepared instead of finding myself hungry with no snacks on standby etc. She even made up recipes for me to try.  I fully recommend that Bethany do anyone a plan for their lifestyle whatever the problem, mine was a challenging one and she rose to the challenge!  Thank you Bethany.</p>

						<div class="col-md-9">The meal plan and grocery list also correlated to Bethany's recipe guide that was included in her book. The recipes were easy to follow, quick to make and DELICIOUS. Even my husband likes the food. So far, a week following the plan and I feel I have more energy, feel fitter and have a better sense of wellbeing. Highly recommend!</div>
